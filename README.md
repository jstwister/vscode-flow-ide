# vscode-flow-ide

An alternative Flowtype extension for Visual Studio Code. Flowtype is a static type checker
meant to find errors in Javascript programs.

## Features

3. Parameter hints

4. Inline flow type coverage
    Open command pallete(CTRL+SHIFT+P) -> Toggle flow coverage: you will see an inline display of the code
    covered by Flow.


## Requirements

* Have a `.flowconfig` file in project root
* Make sure you have NodeJS in path
* Make sure you have Flow installed globally or locally. We recommnend
using `flow-bin` NPM package.
* If you get the error `'types' can only be used in a .ts file`,
please set `javascript.validate.enable` option to `false`.


## Extension Settings
This extension contributes the following settings:

* `flowide.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `flowide.pathToFlow`: Absolute path to the Flow executable. Set it only if the default behaviour of the extension
doesn't work out for you. The extension will try first
to read it from local `node_modules/flow-bin` or globally if not otherwise set here.
* `flowide.useCodeSnippetsOnFunctionSuggest` - Add the function paramters when selecting a function
to autocomple.

## Known Issues

* Parameter hints are not highlighted as the user types.
